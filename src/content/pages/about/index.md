![Sean profile](./seanjun-autumn.jpg)

Hi, I'm Sean, a full stack developer currently working at Digital Air Strike.
I build web apps primarily with React/Redux, Express, NodeJS, and Mongo/Postgres.
I believe that my past work and programming share something very important in common:

_**"passionate work can greatly benefit our communities."**_

It is my personal and professional goal to continue giving back as a developer.
